# Cyber-Security-Network
Insights and Outcomes

Multiple datasets representing various cyberattack types (e.g., FTPWrite, Neptune, Smurf) were analyzed.
Exploratory data analysis revealed no missing values and provided summaries of categorical and continuous variables.
Feature Engineering:

Data was split into categorical and continuous variables.
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, outliers) were calculated to understand the spread and potential anomalies.
Outlier Treatment:

Continuous variables were clipped at the 1st and 99th percentiles to handle extreme values.
Label Encoding:

Attack categories were encoded for binary and multinomial classification tasks (e.g., Normal=0, Back=1).
Data Integration:

Cleaned and transformed datasets from different attack types were concatenated to create a unified dataset for analysis.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Binary Classification: KNN classifier was used to predict whether a network connection is an attack or normal.
Multinomial Classification: Multiple attack types were classified using extended datasets.
ROC-AUC scores were calculated to evaluate the performance of models on training and test datasets.
Tools and Libraries:

Statistical libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scipy) and visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data analysis.
Machine learning techniques (e.g., GridSearchCV, StandardScaler) for feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning.
Approach Details:
Problem Identification:

The goal was to detect and classify cyberattacks in network data to strengthen security measures.
Data Preprocessing:

Uniformity was ensured across datasets with consistent column names and formats.
Data imbalance was addressed through resampling techniques.
Feature Importance:

Key features such as src_bytes, dst_bytes, count, and same_srv_rate were analyzed for their role in identifying suspicious activities.
Validation Strategy:

The dataset was split into training and testing subsets for unbiased evaluation.
Cross-validation ensured robust model performance.
Advanced Techniques:

Nessus vulnerability scans and other attack-specific tools were simulated for enriched datasets.
How It Can Be Impactful for a Company:
Proactive Defense: Insights from the analysis enable organizations to identify and mitigate network vulnerabilities proactively.
Efficient Monitoring: Implementing the models in real-time systems can enhance intrusion detection capabilities.
Strategic Planning: Helps in prioritizing cybersecurity resources to address the most critical threats effectively.
